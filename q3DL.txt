Q.Extract the filename including suffix from a full file path

Function Definition:-

CREATE or REPLACE function file_lastindex(lastpath IN VARCHAR2)
   RETURN varchar2

IS
   file_var VARCHAR2(100);

BEGIN
  IF INSTR(lastpath,'\') > 0 THEN
      file_var := SUBSTR(lastpath,(INSTR(lastpath,'\',-1,1)+1),length(lastpath));

/*In INSTR it searches for the 1st occurance of '\' in 'lastpath' from backward direction since -1 is put and that value is put as Starting index for SUBSTR which returns length(lastpath) characters staring at index given by INSTR. +1 is added in INSTR to put move the index to next char after '\'. */

   -- If no slashes were found, return the original string
   ELSE
      file_var := lastpath;

   END IF;

   RETURN file_var;

END;


Function call:-

declare
l_file varchar2(30);
begin
l_file:=file_lastindex('E:\Project\webapps\bin\src\index.html');
dbms_output.put_line(l_file);
end;
